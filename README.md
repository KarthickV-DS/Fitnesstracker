# Fitnesstracker
This project is a fitness tracker that utilizes data from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to monitor and analyze exercise performance. The system applies signal processing techniques, such as low-pass filtering, to extract meaningful patterns from raw sensor data and count repetitions for various exercises.
