This project is a fitness tracker designed to monitor and analyze exercise performance using data from accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. The system applies signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees, to detect exercise patterns and count repetitions accurately.

Features
Sensor Data Processing: Utilizes accelerometer and gyroscope data from fitness devices to compute the total acceleration (acc_r) and gyroscope magnitude (gyr_r).

Low-Pass Filtering: Smooths the sensor data using a low-pass filter to remove noise and make pattern recognition easier.

Repetition Counting: Automatically detects and counts repetitions for different exercises like squats, bench press, deadlifts, rows, and overhead presses.

Machine Learning Models: Implements several machine learning models to predict exercise metrics and validate accuracy:
  Random Forest Classifier: A powerful ensemble method used to predict the number of reps based on sensor features.
  Neural Networks: A deep learning model that learns complex patterns from sensor data to improve accuracy in rep prediction.
  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A distance-based model used for classification of exercise data.
  Decision Trees: A simple, interpretable model that helps classify exercise types and predict repetitions.
  Model Evaluation: Performance evaluation is done using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) and accuracy to compare the modelsâ€™ effectiveness in rep prediction.

Exercises Supported

  Machine Learning Models
  Random Forest Classifier: A powerful ensemble model that uses multiple decision trees to classify and predict exercise repetitions.
  Neural Networks: A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) used for deeper learning of the sensor data patterns.
  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple model that classifies data points based on the nearest neighbors in feature space.
  Decision Tree Classifier: A decision-making model that splits data into branches to classify exercise types and predict repetitions.
How It Works
